    "## Technical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Modeling and Warehousing\n",
    "Question: How do you design a schema for a new data-intensive application?\n",
    "To design a schema for a new data-intensive application, I would first need to understand the business requirements and use cases. Then I would analyze the expected data types, relationships and queries. With that information, I would choose an appropriate data model, such as relational, NoSQL, etc. I would also consider requirements such as scalability, performance and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ETL/ELT Design and Implementation\n",
    "Question: Describe a complex ETL pipeline you've designed. What were some of the challenges, and how did you address them?\n",
    "I created an ETL with Python (Pandas, Colab) to generate a critical report for the company from lots of files about project initiatives with a level of risk for the company from all the countries where the company was located. Due to that wasn't measured and visible, the company had to pay a lot of money in fines, so I made the company save a lot of money. It was a challenge because I only had a free layer on Google Colab, so I had to optimize the code in order to meet the requirement successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Infrastructure and Orchestration\n",
    "Question: What experience do you have with managing data infrastructure on-premises or in the cloud?\n",
    "I have experience managing data infrastructure both on-premises and in the cloud. On-premises, I've worked with traditional database servers, data warehouses, etc.. In the cloud, I have experience with AWS and Google Cloud Platform services, such as S3 for storage, BigQuery for databases, as well as NoSQL DataBases. However, I consider myself to have basic experience regarding infrastructure matters, In spite of this, I am a quick really good learner, I love learn new things and apply immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Programming and Software Engineering Practices\n",
    "Question: What programming languages are you most comfortable with, and what libraries do you frequently use in data engineering projects?\n",
    "I am most comfortable with Python and SQL for data engineering projects. In Python, I frequently use libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, as well as Numpy. I have worked with other programming languages such as Java, C#, Progress 4GL, however Python is my main language.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Security and Compliance\n",
    "Question: How do you implement security measures in your data engineering projects?\n",
    "To implement security measures, it is important to follow best practices such as encryption of data in transit and at rest, role-based access control, secure authentication, and secure authentication. "

    "\n",
    "Code Challenge Description\n",
    "Title: Building a MySQL Database Interface in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a Python application that interfaces with a MySQL database. The application will manage a dataset representing sales data for a tech company that sells various products across multiple countries. Your goal is to establish a database connection, create a table, and populate this table with sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Database Connection:\n",
    "Implement a Python function to establish a connection to a MySQL database using provided credentials (host, username, password, and database name).\n",
    "Define and Create a Table:\n",
    "Write SQL commands within your Python script to create a table named sales. This table should have columns for id, country, category, price, quantity, and final_sales, with appropriate data types.\n",
    "Insert Data:\n",
    "Prepare a series of SQL INSERT statements to populate the sales table with the provided sample data. Ensure each record accurately reflects the sales data format.\n",
    "Execute Queries:\n",
    "Write functions to execute SQL queries to create the table and insert data into the table. Include error handling to manage potential SQL execution errors.\n",
    "Expected Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script that can be run to connect to a MySQL database, create the necessary table, and populate it with data.\n",
    "Your script should handle common errors that might occur during database operations, such as connection failures or SQL syntax errors.\n",
    "Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness: The script should correctly execute all database operations without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Quality: Code should be clear, well-organized, and appropriately commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: The script should effectively handle and report errors during database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: SQL operations should be written efficiently to optimize execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup Instructions\n",
    "Just use mysql local community server and a made up data set related to sales of devices in a tech company \n",
    "https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 Sales \n",

    "    other_specs .\n",
    "Ensure you have mysql-connector-python installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip install mysql-connector-python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips for Success\n",
    "Test each part of your script incrementally to ensure that each function behaves as expected.\n",
    "Consider the edge cases, such as what happens if the table already exists or the database connection cannot be established.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is designed to test your ability to integrate Python programming with SQL database management, reflecting tasks you may handle as a data engineer in our organization. Good luck!\n"

    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Develop a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that integrates data from multiple sources, applies specific transformations, and then loads the transformed data into a new table. This challenge tests your ability to handle data programmatically, showcasing your skills in data manipulation, SQL integration, and Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "A tech company has multiple tables storing sales and product details. The sales table records transactions including the country, product category, and sales details. The product table includes specifications like capacity and color. Your task is to extract data from these tables, apply transformations to derive new insights, and load the results into a new structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract:\n",
    "Write a Python function to retrieve data from the existing sales and product tables. The extracted data should include country, category, product capacity, color, quantity sold, and final sales amount.\n",
    "Transform:\n",
    "Implement transformations to calculate the total revenue for each product (defined as quantity * final_sales).\n",
    "Categorize each transaction based on sales volume into 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'.\n",
    "Load:\n",
    "Design and create a new table called transformed_sales to store the transformed data.\n",
    "Load the transformed data into this table with appropriate field names and data types.\n",
    "Expected Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script that implements the ETL process.\n",
    "The script should include functions for connecting to a MySQL database, executing SQL queries, and handling any potential errors.\n",
    "Documentation within the script explaining the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.\n",
    "Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness: The script should correctly execute all steps of the ETL process without errors.\n",
    "Efficiency: Code and queries should be optimized for performance, especially when handling large datasets.\n",
    "Code Quality: The code should be well-organized, properly commented, and easy to read.\n",
    "Error Handling: The script should include robust error handling to manage and log potential issues during the database operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "Automating ETL tasks is crucial for ensuring data accuracy and availability in real-time or near-real-time for analysis and decision-making. Airflow is a platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the Python Functions:\n",
    "Extract Function: Implement logic to extract data from a predefined data source. This could be a database, a file, an API, or any simulated data source.\n",
    "Transform Function: Apply necessary data transformations which could include cleaning, aggregating, or any other form of data manipulation.\n",
    "Load Function: Implement the logic to load the transformed data into a specified target, which could be a database or a data warehouse.\n",
    "Integrate Functions with Airflow:\n",
    "Use the provided Airflow DAG skeleton to integrate your Python functions.\n",
    "Configure the DAG to ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order, handling dependencies correctly.\n",

    "API Data Integration Code Challenge Description\n",
    "Title: API Data Handling and Integration Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Develop a Python application that fetches data from an external API, applies specified transformations, and outputs the processed data. This challenge is designed to test your abilities in API interaction, data manipulation, and the application of basic data processing principles in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "APIs are a crucial data source in many software systems and data pipelines. Effective handling and integration of API data are key skills for developers and data engineers, involving tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and preparation for further analysis or storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract Data:\n",
    "Write a Python function to fetch data from a given API endpoint. This function should handle network errors, API rate limits, and other common issues that can occur during API interaction.\n",
    "Transform Data:\n",
    "Implement logic to transform the raw data fetched from the API. Assume the data includes various product details; extract and format this data into a structured JSON format that focuses on specific fields like product_id, product_name, category, and price.\n",
    "Output Data:\n",
    "Instead of loading the data into a database or storage system, output the transformed data to the console or a file in a clean, readable format. This simulates the final step in an ETL process where data is made available for further use.\n",
    "Expected Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script that efficiently and correctly extracts, transforms, and outputs data as described.\n",
    "Effective use of exception handling to manage potential errors during the API request.\n",
    "Logging throughout the process to track operations and facilitate debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness and Completeness: The script should correctly fetch and process the API data according to the specifications provided.\n",
    "Error Handling: Robust handling of errors and exceptional conditions in the API interaction.\n",
    "Code Quality: The code should be clean, well-organized, commented, and follow best practices for Python development.\n",
    "Output Formatting: The transformed data should be outputted in a structured and readable format, demonstrating an understanding of data presentation.\n",
    "Instructions for Setup and Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the requests and logging libraries are installed in your Python environment.\n",
    "Use any public API endpoint of your preference if tech_company related would be better.\n",
    "\n"
